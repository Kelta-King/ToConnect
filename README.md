# ToConnect
ToCoonect Platform is a computerized system which helps the user to overcome their life issues with the help of a virtual counsellor in electronic format. It saves time as the system is placed friendly. It even provides the user with their counselling sessions history. It can be helpful to those users also who are suffering from some issues but not comfortable to talk with the counsellor face-to-face. And even some times, a person (user) feels uncomfortable to tell their problem to the counsellor in face to face. In this type of case, ToConnect can play a major role.  The main perspective is to create an interactive and friendly environment between the counsellor and the person (user).
