# ToConnect
ToCoonect Platform is a computerized system which helps the user to overcome their life issues with the help of a virtual counsellor in electronic format. :smiley: It saves time as the system is placed friendly. It even provides the user with their counselling sessions history. It can be helpful to those users also who are suffering from some issues but not comfortable to talk with the counsellor face-to-face. And even some times, a person (user) feels uncomfortable to tell their problem to the counsellor in face to face. In this type of case, ToConnect can play a major role.  The main perspective is to create an interactive and friendly environment between the counsellor and the person (user). :open_mouth:

<p>Allow your webpage's audio to talk with the virtual concellor via chat. Concellor will send messages as well as speak with you. You can turn off the audio if you don't like to listen the same thing which you are reading.</p>
<p>If you want to change the webpage's settings then click on the settings button or click on the button on the right top with your username written on it. A new popup settings modal comes in. You can change your password username and website's theme over there.</p>
